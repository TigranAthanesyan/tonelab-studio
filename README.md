This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Database Setup

This project uses MongoDB with Mongoose for data persistence. The database connection is configured using environment variables.

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory with the following variables:

```
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloudinary_cloud_name
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_cloudinary_api_key
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_cloudinary_api_secret
```

### Cloudinary Setup

1. Sign up for a free Cloudinary account at [cloudinary.com](https://cloudinary.com)
2. Get your credentials from the Dashboard
3. Add them to your `.env.local` file
4. Images will be automatically uploaded to Cloudinary and optimized

### Database Models

- **Events**: Contains title, description, date, and ticket price for studio events

### API Endpoints

- `GET /api/events` - Fetch all events
- `POST /api/events` - Create a new event

### Testing the Database

Visit the `/events` page to see a test interface for adding and viewing events from the database.
